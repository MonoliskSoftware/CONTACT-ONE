This project is for the game CONTACT ONE.

CONTACT ONE is a ROBLOX FPS game that features RTS elements to enhance the weight/gravity of the battle.

The game is seperated into the Battle Stack, where players fight on the frontlines, and the Command Stack, where players command units from above.

Players can change in between the Battle and Command stacks at any time. When a character isn't controlled by a player, it'll be controlled by AI.

The game is built with Rojo, Roblox-TS, and a custom made framework called "CORP", which is meant to imitate the componentized model of Unity and their Netcode for GameObjects networking system.
